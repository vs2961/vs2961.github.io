As such, synchronizing user data accurately across sandbox environments is a difficult task that required a full team to complete. As the person spearheading the development of this project, agile planning became a must to ensure proper time to successfully create and offboard the project before my internship ended. On the bright side, working with a tech stack that includes Node.JS, AWS Lambda, Datadog, and Thycotic was an incredible learning opportunity in itself."

My task was to navigate this environment while automating some of the engineer's mundane tasks on Snowflake. These automation projects combined saved hours of engineering time every month, and they included automating user provisioning, baseline verification processes, and providing access information about specific roles and objects."

As a startup, things moved fast and solving problems at this breakneck speed was a unique challenge. For my internship, I used Python to build multiple command-line interfaces that retrieved data from an airline's API, as well as identify any variation between the information provided by their API and their actual website."

For my project, we created a web-scraping car app that gets data from popular car-dealing websites such as KBB or Edmunds, and presented that data dynamically by comparing user-selected cars with other similar cars on the market with gold, silver, and bronze medals.
